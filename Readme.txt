The purpose of this project is to create interesting geometric designs utilizing the javascript platform. 

Included is an HTML template file that will allow the user to utilize the js code in any modern browser. 


Sierpinski_triangle.js will create a Sierpinski triangle design using a recursive call in the canvas.

Triangle.js will create a random regular polygon in the center of the canvas and allow the user to change
the number of sides and speed of rotation. This is a demonstration code, but the Shape object can be easily
repurposed to print any regular polygon on the canvas.
